Lesson 3 Reflections

A major item not brought up when doing a git push to a remote sit is that you will need to enter your User ID and password for
that site - in this case the GITHUB site. The user name will show up as you type but the password will not show and the cursor
will not move. 

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

It depends on the type of work. If it is something that multiple people will be working on then it would be better for it to be
in a remote repository so everyone can have access to it. For work that is sensitive it should not be in a remote repository.

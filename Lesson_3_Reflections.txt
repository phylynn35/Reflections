Lesson 3 Reflections

A major item not brought up when doing a git push to a remote sit is that you will need to enter your User ID and password for
that site - in this case the GITHUB site. The user name will show up as you type but the password will not show and the cursor
will not move. 

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

It depends on the type of work. If it is something that multiple people will be working on then it would be better for it to be
in a remote repository so everyone can have access to it. For work that is sensitive it should not be in a remote repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You may not be ready for the changes to be seen by others or all of the changes have not been made yet. Also if it is a new branch what is being done may not be for public use. 
 

 Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

 Forks are the same as clones but it is only done on GITHUB. Branches are only done on the local site. Clones are done on the local site or between local and a remote.

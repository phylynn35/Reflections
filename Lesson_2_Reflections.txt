Lesson_2_Reflections

What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates an empty repository (or file) with the name specified.  You use enter the following - git init (name of repository) then can do a git status to see if it has been set up okay.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is the place were your items are initially loaded. They are then moved to the working directory. This helps keeps files in order and prevents changes from being used before they are ready. 

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

If you are making multiple changes to the same file (or document) then you need to add one change at a time to the staging area then commit it then go back and add the next change. If the changes are to multiple files (or documents) and each change is to a different file (or document) then add all of them to the staging area at the same time but only commit one change at a time.
